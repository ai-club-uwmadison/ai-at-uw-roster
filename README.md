[Chris Endemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-endemann/)
helped co-found AI@UW in 2017, and has since played a lead role in managing and directing the club's operations. His interest in AI/ML research stems primarily from his love for reverse engineering the neural algorithms controlling sensation (i.e. qualia), perception (i.e. categorization of qualia), memory processing, and decision-making behavior. In the past, Chris has developed several large scale analysis pipelines to more reliably decode various information traces from the brain using unsupervised learning and deep learning approaches, and has studied the interactions between pupil diameter and decision making behavior using reinforcement learning models. Under the mentorship of [Dr. Matthew Banks](https://neuro.wisc.edu/staff/banks-matthew-i/) and [Dr. Barry Van Veen](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Vanveen_Barry/), he is currently applying multivariate time series modeling techniques to reveal the neural connectivity dynamics underlying conscious and unconscious sensory processing. In his spare time, Chris enjoys leading the [Algorithmic Trading Team](https://ai-club-uwmadison.github.io/projects/) in an effort to predict stock market trends, and the [Neuro-Inspired AGI](https://ai-club-uwmadison.github.io/projects/) study group to discuss the interactions between the fields of artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience.

[Keshav Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshav1905/) co-founded AI@UW in 2017, and has been leading the club's marketing. He has mentored [Stanford's online course on Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Andrew Ng.  Keshav has also interned at [UW's IoT Research Center](https://iotcenter.engr.wisc.edu/) and [Pivotal](http://pivotal.io). Currently, he is working with [Google](https://google.com) to improve onboarding of students onto Cloud technologies. Upon graduation, Keshav will be joining [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io) as a product manager.
