[Chris Endemann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-endemann/)
helped co-found AI@UW in 2017, and has since played a lead role in managing and directing the club's operations. His interest in AI/ML research stems primarily from his love for reverse engineering the neural algorithms controlling sensation (i.e. qualia), perception (i.e. categorization of qualia), memory processing, and decision-making behavior. In the past, Chris has developed several large scale analysis pipelines to more reliably decode various information traces from the brain using unsupervised learning and deep learning approaches, and has studied the interactions between pupil diameter and decision making behavior using reinforcement learning models. Under the mentorship of [Dr. Matthew Banks](https://neuro.wisc.edu/staff/banks-matthew-i/) and [Dr. Barry Van Veen](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Vanveen_Barry/), he is currently applying multivariate time series modeling techniques to reveal the neural connectivity dynamics underlying conscious and unconscious sensory processing. In his spare time, Chris enjoys leading the engr-stocks team in an effort to predict stock market trends, and the study-neuro-agi group to discuss the interactions between the fields of artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience.

[Abhay Venkatesh](http://abhayvenkatesh.com) co-founded AI@UW in April, 2017, and served as the founding President for the club. In the past, he has interned and worked with [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [Stanford](https://stanford.edu), and [MIT](https://mit.edu). Currently, he is responsible for advising the club on operations, and heading the engineering efforts of the club. He is a research assistant for [Dr. Vikas Singh](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/), doing work in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
